# h2mg
This is a Python implementation of the H2-MG algorithm. The method combines the hierarchical structure of the H2 matrix with the multigrid approach, enabling efficient solutions of large systems with dense symmetric positive definite matrices.
## Requirenments

The minimum requirement by H2-MG is [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [h2tools](https://bitbucket.org/muxas/h2tools).

## Quick Start

You can find Jupyter notebooks with 1D and 2D examples of the H2-MG algorithm for Gaussian and exponential kernels in the 'notebooks' folder.
